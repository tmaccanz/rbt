                    <h5>Do not get a spray tan if you are peeling!</h5>
                    <h5>Please shave/wax/shower/exfoliate at least 3 hours
                    before your tan! Your skin needs to be dry & your
                    pores closed to ensure the best development of your tan. 
                    </h5>
                    <h5>Exfoliate! This is the most important tip as you
                    are removing all of your almost dead skin cells and
                    creating a fresh canvas for your tan to work with (avoid oil based exfoliants).
                    </h5>
                    <h5>Use minimal soap prior to your tanning.</h5>
                    <h5>Do not apply moisturisers, deodorant or wash your hair immediately before
                    tanning as the residue acts as a barrier (wipes are available to wipe underarms if
                    you need to).
                    </h5>
                    <h5>Remember to bring loose fitting clothing to put on after your tan.</h5>
                    <div class="treatment__text">Post Tan</div>
                    <h5>We will discuss your post tan procedure with you during your appointment.</h5>
                    <h5>Avoid any water until your first rinse off shower (careful washing your hands as any drop will damage your tan)!</h5>
                    <h5>Quick rinse off until water runs clear.</h5>
                    <h5>Always pat dry after every shower.</h5>
                    <h5>No moisturiser after 1st shower.</h5>
                    <h5>Use a PH balanced body wash from day two of your tan when you can now shower as normal.</h5>
                    <h5>To keep your tan looking even & to ensure it lasts as long as possible it is
                    recommended to moisturise daily with PH balanced moisturisers (for best
                    results use a tan extender available for sale in salon) avoid thick creams & Shea butter.</h5>
                    <h5>Chlorine in pools/spas will strip your tan as chlorine is a bleach.</h5>
                    <h5>Please don't hesitate to phone or message us with any queries and most of all enjoy being a bronzed goddess!</h5>
